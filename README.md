# 🐝 Predicting Honeybee Health from Hive Weather

Welcome to **Predicting Honeybee Health from Hive Weather**! This dataset and project explore the relationship between **environmental conditions** and **honeybee colony health**, helping researchers and beekeepers understand the impact of climate on bee populations.

## 📌 Dataset Overview
- 🌡 **Weather Conditions:** Tracks temperature, humidity, and precipitation  
- 🍯 **Bee Colony Metrics:** Hive activity, survival rates, and honey production  
- 🏞 **Geospatial Insights:** Regional differences in bee health based on climate  
- 📊 **Predictive Modeling:** Uses machine learning to forecast colony health  

## 📂 Data Format
The dataset is structured in CSV format with key attributes:
- `Date` – Timestamp of recorded environmental and hive data  
- `Location` – Geographic region of hive monitoring  
- `Temperature (°C)` – External environmental temperature  
- `Humidity (%)` – Atmospheric humidity level  
- `Rainfall (mm)` – Precipitation recorded in hive location  
- `Colony Size` – Number of bees per hive  
- `Honey Production (kg)` – Amount of honey yielded per period  
- `Health Index` – Composite score measuring hive stability  

## 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository to start analyzing honeybee health:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predicting-Honeybee-Health.git
cd Predicting-Honeybee-Health


Load the dataset in Python:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("Honeybee_Health_Data.csv")
print(data.head())
